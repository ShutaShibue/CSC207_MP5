This project implements text to speach function to support people with disabilities. There is a frontend that shows picture, and speaks the content when the picture is clicked. It can also make a group of picture using AACCategory.  
AACMappings keeps track of all AACCategories using Associative Array which was brought from past Mini-project.  
AACCategory holds relationship between image and texts to talk.
